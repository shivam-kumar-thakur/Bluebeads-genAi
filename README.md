## 1. Problem Statement

In 2022, it was reported that India needs 15 million units of blood each year but manages to collect only 11 million units. Despite this, India wastes about 6.5 lakh units of blood and blood components each year due to lack of facilities, resulting in an alarming death count of 12,000 per year.[(Business Insider: INDIA)](https://www.businessinsider.in/science/health/news/nearly-12000-individuals-die-every-day-due-to-lack-of-quality-blood/articleshow/92196089.cms) 

The existing systems often lack efficiency in connecting potential donors with those in need, leading to critical delays and sometimes irreversible consequences. This underscores the urgent need for a robust, technologically advanced platform to bridge the gap between donors and those seeking blood during emergencies.
